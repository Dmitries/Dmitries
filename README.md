# Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ˜„ Everything About Me (or almost) 
###### My name is Dmitry and I'm 19. I study in a college in the second course.
I've been doing web-programming for 1 year at the moment.  I was doing different projects for practice.  
For instance: Authorization and Registration using sessions, created Restfull api, created to-do lists, personal blog and many others.  
The most things above it is very easy ones, that's why I didn't publish everything to my github.

  
In addition I gotta one more hobby! It is **English language** although my level leaves up to be desired. I'm learning English in parallel with a programming. It is really inspires me! At present I have something between Pre-Intermediate and Intermediate level. I'm trying to become better and better every day. All my time is spending only on it. (English and Programming, of course).

**Languages which I have worked**:  
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- PHP
- SQL

Other additional technologies:
- Bootstrap
- Materialize.css
- Scss
- Gulp
- jQuery
- Vue.js
- Laravel

** :relieved: I'm grateful to you that you spent your time on reading this!**
