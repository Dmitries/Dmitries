##### Everything About Me (or almost) 
###### :metal: My name is Dmitry and I'm 19. I study in a college in the second course.
I've been doing web-programming for 1 year at the moment.  I was doing different projects for practice.  
For instance: Authorization and Registration using sessions, created Restfull api, created to-do lists, personal blog and many others.  
The most things above it is very easy ones, that's why I didn't publish everything to my github. :see_no_evil:  
My favorite stack for work: php-Laravel 8 :heart:

  
:tada: In addition I gotta one more hobby! It is **English language** although my level leaves up to be desired. I'm learning English in parallel with a programming. It is really inspires me! At present I have something between Pre-Intermediate and Intermediate level. I'm trying to become better and better every day. All my time is spending only on it. (English and Programming, of course).
